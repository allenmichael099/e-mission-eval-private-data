    "## Usage\n",
    "To use, starting with a database dump tarball for each of the pilot programs plus stage:\n",
    "\n",
    "  1. Expand each tarball into its own folder\n",
    "  2. Make a new empty folder and start `mongod`, using the `--dbpath` option to tell it to store the database in that empty folder\n",
    "  3. `mongorestore` each of the dumps, one at a time, verifying that there are no weird errors. I did this in ascending order of dump size except ending with stage.\n",
    "  4. Ideally you would have \"0 document(s) failed to restore\" for all of the `mongorestore`s, but I consistently get `1400` documents failing to restore for `fc` and `1402` for `cc`.\n",
    "  5. Set the proper environment variables so this notebook can find the `emission` scripts (I do this for myself with a slightly hacky `sys.path.insert` below)\n",
    "  6. Run the notebook top to bottom. It should take on the order of 20 minutes (benchmarked on a 2015 MacBook Air) and run without errors. It takes massive (a few gigabytes) amounts of RAM, both in the `python` process and on the part of `mongod`.\n",
    "  7. The notebook is structured to load everything it needs from the database in the first few cells and then does not rely on the database again, so if you are tweaking later analyses and want to recover some RAM you can terminate the `mongod` process.\n",
    "\n",
    "tl;dr: this relies on a rather specific database configuration."

    "Dataset 1 -- no \"after\" condition necessary:\n",
    " * Number of participants\n",
    " * Unlabeled trips that users need not interact with at all\n",
    " * Trips that would be in To Label with no red labels\n",
    "\n",
    "Dataset 2 -- yes \"after\" condition necessary:\n",
    " * Number of participants\n",
    " * Frequency of app opens\n",
    " * Taps actually avoided by verify button\n",
    " * Taps actually avoided by hiding high confidence trips\n",

    "### New features\n",
    " * Graphs of weekly labeling percentage and number of days per week the app was used over time\n",
    " * Comparisons of pilot programs that started before the update was released to pilot programs that started with the update already installed\n",
    " * Histogram of expectation confidences, segmented by how they are presented to the user\n",

    " * Visualization of how we save taps\n",
    " * Summary of all the numbers used in the draft paper\n",
    "\n",
    "### Still to do\n",
    " * What happens if we were to change the confidence thresholds? Can we save users more taps? This should be explored by figuring out how much of the current tapping is correcting the algorithm vs. filling in red labels vs. simply not using the new features -- which can be done with the \"select_label\" instrumentation event. If we lower the low threshold, we would expect the number of taps used to fill in red labels to decrease, but not the other two categories of taps.\n",
    " * Try to measure the time spent on each of the screens from which it is possible to label (To Label, All Unlabeled, Diary, etc.) -- this might be difficult, but it would be useful both to do a comparison between screens and also to see if this update changes the amount of time people spend labeling.\n",
    " * Maybe some more per-program breakdowns would be useful?\n",
    " * Statistical tests might be useful."
